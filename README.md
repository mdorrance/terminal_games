War in terminal

This is my version of the card game War run in terminal.

The code logic works for both battles and upto a triple war.

lib/terminal_war_2.rb is my final version as of 6/17/13

Work to be done:<br>

   :add testing<br>
   
terminal_war.rb is my first version before starting to refactor the code
