war in terminal

This is my version of the card game War run in terminal.

The code logic works for battles and war.

terminal_war.rb

Work to be done:
   :handle player_1 [] and player_2 []
    when arrays of hashes are pushed into the player hand after winning a battle or war 
   :add testing
   :remove puts statements for error reporting/ debugging
   
terminal_war_2.rb
  : comments out all troubleshooting puts statements for cleaner run
  : same code
