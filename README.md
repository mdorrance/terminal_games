war in terminal

This is my version of the card game War run in terminal.

The code logic works for battles and war.

terminal_war.rb

Work to be done:<br>
   :handle player_1 [] and player_2 []<br>
    when arrays of hashes are pushed into the player hand array after winning a battle or war <br>
   :add testing<br>
   :remove puts statements for error reporting/ debugging<br>
   
terminal_war_2.rb
  : comments out all troubleshooting puts statements for cleaner run
  : same code
